I am a Senior Data Scientist, specialising in R&D of large scale recommender systems, fairness and bias in AI systems and the impact they have on end users. Recent projects include leading a team in auditing AI, ultimately identifying and rectifying Gender bias in Elsevierâ€™s people recommenders. This work results in fairness metrics being used in OKRs for product managers, and leading department discussions in machine learning fairness and the impact of recommender systems on minorities and intersectional groups. 

## PhD Summary

My PhD focused on the application of ML to large scale prediction of viral content within social media. The models were trained on billions of observations aiming to predict the change in a community's language. Not only predicting how far content would diffuse but also who controlled the follow of the diffusion and who were susceptible to adopt new content.

I am a Senior Data Scientist, specialising in research and development of large scale content recommenders, text summarisation and knowledge extraction systems. Recent projects include the deployment of a deep learning extractive text summarisation on 200k+ scientific documents using hierarchical sequence-based LSTM models which delivered against KPIs to increase user engagement and document submission success. I additionally lead the introduction of new technologies such as Sagemaker, Tensorflow and human-in-the-loop validation frameworks. 

I am looking for a new role where I can deliver impact, develop my research and development skills, scale ML platforms and promote the adoption of modern technologies.

## PhD Summary

My PhD focused on the application of ML methods to large scale prediction of viral content within social media, resulting in the development of large scale ML models (Java, Python). I trained these models on billions of observations (1Tb+ processed in Hadoop and Spark) in predicting the change of a community's language. Not only predicting how far content would diffuse but also who controlled the follow of the diffusion and who were susceptible to adopt new content.
